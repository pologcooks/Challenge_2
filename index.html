            <b><p>1985 Jordan 1 Chicago</p></b>
            <p>The shoe that started it all, the Air Jordan 1 can be easily spotted by sneakerheads and non-sneakerheads alike from a mile away. Designed by Peter Moore, the OG colorways of the Air Jordan 1 were released from 1985 to 1986. FTYKICKS is lucky to obtain a pair of the 1985 Chicago jordan pair.</p>
